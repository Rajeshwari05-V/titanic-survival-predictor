# 🚀 90-Day AI/ML Journey – Titanic Survival Predictor

Welcome to my **90-Day AI/ML Journey**!  
This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn and apply Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning.  
Each day I build on the previous, moving from **basic Python** ➝ **data cleaning** ➝ **feature engineering** ➝ **ML models** ➝ **deployment**.

## 📅 Progress Log

### ✅ Completed
- **Day 1** → *Python Crash Course* 🐍  
  - Learned Python basics (variables, loops, functions).  
  - First script: `day1_hello_python.py`.  

- **Day 2** → *Titanic Data Cleaning* 🧹  
  - Loaded Titanic dataset (`train.csv`).  
  - Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin`).  
  - Saved intermediate dataset: `titanic_clean.csv`.  

- **Day 3** → *Feature Engineering on Titanic* ⚙️  
  - Encoded categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`, `Title`).  
  - Created new features: `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`.  
  - Saved notebook: `day3_titanic_cleaning.ipynb`.  
  - ✅ Pushed progress to GitHub.

### 🔜 Upcoming (Next Steps)
- **Day 4** → Train Logistic Regression model on Titanic 🚢.  
- **Day 5** → Implement Decision Tree & Random Forest 🌳.  
- **Day 6** → Evaluate models (accuracy, confusion matrix, feature importance).  
- **Beyond** → Hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and deployment.
